# Rizumu (リズム)

A music app. don't know what else to add

# Components

- backend: unified backend that handles it all
- tui: front facing part

# Deps

- yt-dlp
- ffmpeg
- spotdl

# > [!NOTE]

> need to use acoustID, to get music metadata, since download from youtube doesn't have it (if somehow yt music api doesn't work. there is a ytmusic api right. right!!!)
